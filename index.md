	+ Built a warning system for sending real-time notifications with GPS information if the result from the ground scanning system triggers the warning
	+ Compared and analyzed the performance of several deep learning state-of-the-art models with the LIAEHU dataset including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLO X, MobileNetSSDv2, and EfficientDet with TensorFlow and Pytorch -->

<!-- - [PAAg: Closed-Loop Precision Animal Agriculture](https://www.purdue.edu/rosehub/research.animalAg.RoSeHUB.html)
	+ Proposed a CPS reference architecture for closed-loop precision animal agriculture to deliver  individualized care to animals
	+ Leveraged the uniqueness of animal agriculture in security mechanisms, communication (in-body to out-of-body), and real-time data-driven control
	+ Augmented low-cost hardware for high-performance in deployment, testing, and validation 
	+ Built long range (LoRa) communication between the smart collar node and the sensor edge node (inset) with the animal body tissues as the medium for data transmission
	+ Implemented cloud storage and computing by utilizing ThingsBoard to build the dashboard to show sensor value plots temperature, gas, relative humidity, and pressure, based on MQTT protocol -->
<!-- - [Malware Detection for Robot Network Systems](https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3860/1) 
	+ Developed the RoboMal dataset using the controller files of the publicly available autonomous car with Gazebo-based simulation for both robotic systems and simpler embedded actuator-based Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) 
	+ Created [RoboMal dataset](https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3860/1) including a total of 450 binary executable and linkable format (ELF) files with 232 malware files and 218 good software files by modifying gains and scalars and manipulating the proportionalâ€“derivative (PD) control structure
	+ Built a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model with embedding for identifying the maliciousness of the code with an accuracy of 85% and precision of 87% which outperforms than other methods like CNN, GRU, and ANN

- Attitude Control for Fixed-Wing Aircraft using Q-Learning
	+ Proposed a promising automated stabilization model for airplane flight based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
	+ Applied algorithms Q-Learning to high dimensional, non-linear and complex tasks with a simulated aircraft Cessna 172 in JSBSim and X-Plane
	+ Defined a Q-table with the size (states(168), actions(4)) by creating an encoding system by converting discrete action values to continuous values
	+ Implemented sparse reward function and delta reward function which are trained separately and provides rewards respectively for certain states and all states -->
